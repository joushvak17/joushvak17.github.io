    <p> My name is Joushva Kamble and the school that I am attending this year is University at Buffalo and I am majoring in computer science. This is my first year of college and my goals that I have laid out for myself is to get my degree in computer science and then go to business school. The high school that I attended was Aviation High School, a trade school that taught students how to fix and maintain airplanes. During senior year we had to take a federal test to test our knowledge on the trade and I received one of the two licenses to fix planes. There are many things that I hope to achieve in CSE 199 such as learning about different programming languages and making your own website.</p>

    <p>While I am here at this school, I would like to learn about diffrent types of programming languages such as Python, HTML, JavaScript, and Java which I am currently learning the basics in CSE 115. I find computer science as an intimidating course to take, but I feel that its a course that you can get better at through practice and teaching it to yourself.</p>
    
    <p>For CSE 199 we had to make videos talking about the material that was taught to us in class. Here is the link to those videos:</p>
